# FreeStyler 
- Clive Noonan , Full Stack Student In CODE INSTITUTE

- I am currently a student at the Code Institute Studing Full Stack Diploma in Software Development. 
- This is the first of five projects which I must complete in order to be awarded the globally recognised Diploma 
- from Edinburgh Napier University. This Project utilises The Front End Trifecta .
- This project is based on a custom extreme adventures holiday Business & An App & Geolocation 

- My Main Interest for this project was to work off my own experience , 
- with extreme sports & how a custom holiday company that would or could provided the services needed to fulfill
- the scope of this company would be truly amazing .

- This project was based mainly on the front end area of web develpment, it is a static website,
- It is a fully responsive website, to fit all screen sizes 
- From a broad perspective it does not have a database.

- This business website is entended to lure the user in to see whats it all about, it is based an alpine adventures company which caters for   climbing , sking &  - snowboarding packages, with a company app & api teasers ,
- A small pricing & packing table is provided to try to induce our customer to look further & enquire more.

- The theme of this website is geared towards the sports & travel niche, while sticking to best practises,the colors should protray afeeling - of movement & style,

- The content is intented to be informative to the subjects in point.
- The site is designed in such a way that its not very easy to get lost , when a user is on the guide page, he can not go to the app page , similer , when a  user - is on the app page he can not go to the Guide page , but all pages can be accessed from the home page , reducing the amount of routes to the same origin , this - was indented to reduce fustration & confusion 
 
## UX
 
## Scenario-1
#### User1 recieves a hyperlink link from a friend recommending a website ,User1 clicks the link & has a succesfull connection to the website.

#### User2 recieves a text message with a hyperlink from User1 , User2 clicks the link , after a few moments of surfing the website , User2 decides that they would like to contact the company , scrolling down the page User2 decides to speed up the process & look for the nav-bar, with a quick glance User2 finds the nav-bar & accesses the contact link which in turn sends him to the contact section of the website , User2 is interuppted & never fills out the form 

#### User3 is in work , while chatting on the phone to a college, user3 is recommended a website for a canditate for weekend away for some badly needed R & R , User3 asks for the link , recieves the link thru an email , User3 succesfully connects to the website on his desktop after browsing the site User3 decides to contact the company by way of phone , looking up to the nav which is visible anywhere on the page, clicks the contact section finds the phone number & succesfully contacts the company, User3 then contacts User2 to ask him to email the company for more info , 

#### User2 connects to the website on the bus after recieving slack message from User3, User2 finds the contact section again with ease procides to fill out the form , on filling in the email, half way thru the bus hits a bumb & User2 miss,s the @ symbol , when pressing the send button user2 is propted to correct the mistake , User2 corrects his typo , presses the send button & is transpoted to formspree.io message explaining the process , an option to "Go back to the original site" is clearly stated aswell as confirmation of contact , User2 is pleased

#### User4 leaves his docters practise where he was attending ongoing treatment for dispraxia, User4 recives a message on viber fro User3 recomending a website for there up & coming week away , User4 clicks the hyperlink & connects to the website , after browsing for a few min User4 relises that this is not the type of holiday for him, but is very impressed by the website , while scanning the website on his custom build in monitor he see,s the guide button & clicks the button & is swiftly sent to the guide page , there he is promted with a choice to let the application access his wifi, User4 clicks yes, he can easly make out the functionalty of this app & spots a restaurant only a few minutes away that User1 had recommended, User4 decides he wants to exit the website & looks to the nav, he see,s that there is only 1 logical option , Home , User4 is sent back to the home page , where he again see,s the app link in the nav bar, Users4,s  custom built vehicle stops outside his front door, curious, User4 continues to browse....... 

#### User5 recieves a phone call while sailing in the pacific on his satellite phone , from User3 , the last ten minutes of there conversation was about there weekend away, & asks him to send him the link over a satilite connection, User5 recieves the link & connects on his satilite laptop , he go,s to the "Contact Us" page & hits the submit form by mistake but is met with an error message about the required fields , User5 fills in the form for the first time & submits , agian he is met with an  error message about the required fields, for the third time he access the contact page & see,s that his details are still there , except the @ symbol he was promted about, he fills in the missing field ,submits the form with all inputs valid and verifys that a success message appears. Success User5 is very pleased about the fact even tho it took him 3 attempts , he never left the contact section, User5 see,s the app button in the footer & is curious he contiues to browse ...... 


#### User6 is picked up at 12:30 from creche , after arriving home , user6 picks up his dads phone which is on the counter top, he is very couriuos to screen , he clicks the logo many times , but notices it does move but , he doesnt , he then clicks the traintrack like structures in the corner, he sees the fast like window wiper swoosh in from the side , he then clicks a button before he even looked at the letters , he is brought to the guide page , he clicks all the buttons , except the home button, then he recognises the letters in one word "home" he is then brought to the telly part of the phone , he touches the arrow , he is sent moving down the page , he then see,s a button & presses it , he is brought to a funny looking page with nothing on it, after a larger number of presses he finally sees the letters home once again, presses & is sent home , he decides to keep scrolling , after loosing interest, he decides to look for those train tracks agian ,again he finds them with ease, he see,s the swoosh of the wiper again, & imeteidlty presses a button & is brought to the app page he scrolls all the way to the bottom ,he lands on windows and decides to press , he presses all the windows & the funny looking lollipop stick but nothing happens except flashy things in the phone , User7 arrives home with User6.
###HTML5 Validation Holding strong against even the toughest tests 

#### 2 Weeks Later

### User1 arrive,s at the office , when turning on his computer he notices User4, User3, User2, arrive togther , 10 min late User7 arrives after dropping User6 to creche , User 1 approachs all the Users & begins discussing there week away, after a lengthy discussion , they all make a discion on a date , User4 says to User3 "Will you drop that company we were all sepaking about, an email, you know how I hate using mobile phones, you know the name Freestyler , 4:00 o CLOCK... all the Users meet at the coffe pod on there floor , each one knows what each is other is thinking , User1 looking out the window of Goolge HQ in Dublin Ireland says ," guys do ye realise that Freestyler site is wide open for massive development" , I have contacted ROCC Software & arranged a meeting , looks like we will be holding off on that week lads,

#### User7 pops up & says " has anyone heard from User5 ", they look & relaise, User1 Says OK Lads lets get to work on finding User5, he did mention a restaurant that appeared when using Freestyler pro , we will start there , to be continued......  

### FEATURES
##APP
Along side the main website , there is another element geered towrads the growth & marketing , which comes in the form of a start up & coming app to accompany the customer on there travels , of course this app is top of the line , with the up to date features. 

## API
With a mini feature of an api in the form of an weather API, this is the give the user a quick view of the up and coming app , 
that is the scope of the marketing call for the app page.


## GeoLocation
With one more element which comes in the form of a restaurant API , powered GoogleGeoLoaction, this will request the user location , if the user chooses to agree to the browser then they will have the abilty to see & read the distance from there currrent location to the restaurant which is displyed on the front end, or the users viewport ,
while this feature does not have a database, it requires the data form a small json format in our js script, keepin this in mind to be very slim with the data bacause of googles page speed , 


## HTML FORM VALIDATION

This Project also makes use of HTML form validation
- 2 Contact forms , one on each page gives the user the abilty to contact the company thru the use of Formspree.io,
   this will provide the user with a " back to original site " option , so in turn keeping our user on our website

-  HTML video,    
 
### Existing Features
- All media files being served from AWS, except (logo)

### Features Left to Implement
- Migrate To progressive Web App
- Build the Weather App in Android
- Total dimensional optimisation of all images

## Deployment
On deploying this project , I explored various options such as host providers & Linux Servers, but this approach would of been overkill as it would be hugly beinefcal to give myself the abilty to deploy with just one command line & a open secure connection by the way of Google.

 This led me to FireBase, FireBase is a service in which we can deploy static websites 
 on a free tier with excellent documentation and configeration options, it a excellent choice & can also be upgraded with relevent ease,
 all of this operation is carried out in our google firebase Cloud-console & Installed FireBaseCli, 

 To Deploy this project you need to have the latest version of Node.js installed on your local machine/pc

- After installing Node.js & Checking you have a version number, you will have to navigate to your project folder
  & run firebase init , this will initilise your project directory with a firebase.json file , this file holds the configeration for your deployment

- After initilisation you have to create can account with google firebase, (If you have a gmail, you have a firebase),  
  once logged in to google you will have the abilty to access the firebaseCli & its commands

- Once you are satifactory with your project that you will be deploying, you will have to go your google firebase console, go to the           Hosting tab & create a project, google will give you a default folder of PUBLISH,

- So now we have 3 projects/folders , one on Firebase & one on Your Local Machine & one on GitHub(Providing you versioned controlled your     project),
  now we will have to make sure we are in the matching named folder on our pc , just like GitHub,

- After we have confirmed we are in our project diretory with our firebase.json

- Then it is just a matter of running the command 

- firebase deploy

- Now we have a live static website.

  ## VERSION CONTROL
  The development project folder lives at this address
  [github](https://github.com/90t/publish)

  The deployment project folder lives at this address
  [github](https://github.com/90t/public)

  ## My project can be viewed fully deployed on Firebase [here](https://freestylerallrounder.firebaseapp.com/).


- There is list of firebase commands for development & developers , you can find them here 
- [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/)
    - The project uses **https://firebase.google.com/** 

## To Run this code Locally , you have 2 choices , you can go to [github](https://github.com/90t/public) & download the code directly, 
## Or you can clone this repo with
- [git clone](https://github.com/90t/public.git/)
- Requirments - Node.js - Git 
- Hints , make sure to have a pre made folder when cloning this repo, this is because I already had a Publish repo which was the development     folder/project, so I git versioned the public folder of the deployment folder/project


## THE FUTURE
##### I hope to develop on this project in the future to include a dynamic pricing system.
##### Migration to a PWA.
##### Get 100% in LightHouse
##### Migration to nginx server.





## Credits
- StackOverFlow

### Content
- I wrote all the content 

### Media
- The photos & videos used in this site were obtained from Pexels, Unsplash 

### Acknowledgements
##### I didn't base my work off other code, I used only what I had learnt in syllabuss1/LMS1 & syllabuss2/LMS2(cloud-9).

#### There was also a orignal folder, but this folder was destroyed in a OS crash on my pc , so when my pc was in getting repaired I used a second pc, which I then cloned the project folderfrom the spare pc, when I got my repared pc back I had no internet at the time , so I needed to work on my project locally, so I copied the contents of the cloned project folder from the spare pc  on to a usb stick which I then copied on to my repaired pc , so that is how I ended up with 2 repos for the same project , aswell as the similaritys in the folder names of public & publish , if there is any confusion to this , Student Care Certainly conatct me to clarify.....

### It took me quite a while to work out what happened ......
 

### Final Commit 
### After speaking with my mentor Chris , he advised me content issues, optimisation issues , ux issues in the nav , font issues on mobile view , Removel of local storage , migrate media files

### All issues have been resolved, except Total dimensional optimisation of all images, the reason for this is time.

### This website has gone from Performance 20%, ProgressiveWeApp 29%, Accessibitily 59%, Best Practices 74%, SEO 81%, TO ---> 

### Performance 43%, ProgressiveWeApp 31%, Accessibitily 76%, Best Practices 87%, SEO 100%, I am very pleaed with massive improvement
### In order to increase the performance even more would be transfer all css file inline to all html & migrate all libereires such as Bootstarp
