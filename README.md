Clive Noonan , Full Stack Student In CODE INSTITUTE

I am currently a student at the Code Institute doing a Full Stack Diploma in Software Development. 
This is the first of five projects which I must complete in order to be awarded the globally recognised Diploma 
from Edinburgh Napier University. This project will be based on The Front End Trifecta .
This project is based on a custom extreme adventures holiday. 

My Main Interest for this project was to work off my own experience , 
with extreme sports & how a custom holiday company that would or could provided the services needed to fulfill
the scope of this company would be truly amazing .

This project was based mainly on the front end area of web develpment, it is a static website,
It is a fullty responsive website, to fit all screen sizes 
From a broad perspective it does not have a database.

This business website is entended to lure the user in to see whats in store, it is based an alpine adventures company which caters for climbing , sking & snowboarding packages,
A small pricing & packing table is provided to try to induce our customer to look further & enguire more.

###HTML5 Validation Holding strong against even the toughest tests 

## Features

Along side the main website , there is another element geered towrads the growth & marketing , which comes in the form of a start up & coming app to accompany the customer on there travels,

of course this app is top of the line , with the up to date features, with a mini feature of an api in the form of an weather API, this is the give the user a quick view of the up and coming app , 
that is the scope of the marketing call for the app page 

With one more element which comes in the form of a restaurant API , powered GoogleGeoLoaction, this will request the user location , if the user chooses to agree to the browser then they will have the abilty to see & read the distance from there currrent location to the restaurant which is displyed on the front end, or the users viewport ,

while this feature does not have a database, it requires the data form a small json format in our js script, keepin this in mind to be very slim with the data bacause of googles page speed , 

This Project also makes use of HTML form validation , HTML video,  
 
### Existing Features
- 2 Contact forms , one on each page gives the user the abilty to contact the company thru the use of Formspree.io,
   this will provide the user with a " back to original site " option , so in turn keeping our user on our website

- Migrate To progressive Web App
- Build the Weather App in Android
- Total dimensional optimisation of all images

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
On deploying this project , I explored various options such as host providers & Linux Servers, but this approach would of been overkill as it would be hugly beinefcal to give myself the abilty to deploy with just one command line & a open secure connection by the way of Google.

 This led me to FireBase, FireBase is a service in which we can deploy static websites 
 on a free tier with excellent documentation and configeration options, it a excellent choice & can also be upgraded with relevent ease,
 all of this operation is carried out in our google firebase Cloud-console & Installed FireBaseCli, 

To Deploy this project you need to have the latest version of Node.js installed onlocal machine/pc

- After installing Node.js & Checking you have a version number, you will have to navigate to your project folder
  & run firebase init , this will initilise your project directory with a firebase.json file , this file holds the configeration for your deployment

- After initilisation you have to create can account with google, 
  once logged in to google you will have the abilty to access the firebaseCli & its commands

- Once you are satifactory with your project that you will be deploying, you will have to go your google developers console, go to the         Hosting tab & create a project, google will give you a default folder of PUBLISH,

- So now we have 2 projects/folders , one on Firebase & one on Your Local Machine ,
  now we will have to make sure we are in the matching named folder on our pc , just like GitHub,

- After we have confirmed we are in our project diretory with our firebase.json

- Then it is just a matter of running the command 

- firebase deploy

- Now we have a live static website.

  ## VERSION CONTROL
  The development project folder lives at this address
  [github](https://github.com/90t/publish)

  The deployment project folder lives at this address
  [github](https://github.com/90t/public)

  ##### My project can be viewed fully deployed on Firebase [here](https://freestylerallrounder.firebaseapp.com/).


- There is list of firebase commands for development & developers , you can find them here 
- [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/)
    - The project uses **https://firebase.google.com/** 

## To Run this code Locally , you have 2 choices , you can go to [github](https://github.com/90t/public) & download the code directly, 
## Or you can clone this repo with
- git clone https://github.com/90t/public.git
- Requirments - Node.js - Git 
- Hints , make sure to have a pre made folder when cloning this repo, this is because I already had a Publish repo which was the development     folder/project, so I git versioned the public folder of the deployment folder/project


## THE FUTURE
##### I hope to develop on this project in the future to include a dynamic pricing system.
##### Migration to a PWA.
##### Get 100% in LightHouse
##### Migration to nginx server.
