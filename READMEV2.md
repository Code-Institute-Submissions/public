Clive Noonan , Full Stack Student In CODE INSTITUTE

I am currently a student at the Code Institute doing a Full Stack Diploma in Software Development. 
This is the first of five projects which I must complete in order to be awarded the globally recognised Diploma 
from Edinburgh Napier University. This project will be based on The Front End Trifecta .
This project is based on a custom extreme adventures holiday. 

My Main Interest for this project was to work off my own experience , 
with extreme sports & how a custom holiday company that would or could provided the services needed to fulfill
the scope of this company would be truly amazing .

This project was based mainly on the front end area of web develpment, it is a static website, 
From a broad perspective it does not have a database.

This business website is entended to lure the user in to see whats in store, it is based an alpine adventures company which caters for climbing , sking & snowboarding packages,
A small pricing & packing table is provided to try to induce our customer to look further & enguire more.

## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

Along side the main website , there is another element geered towrads the growth & marketing , which comes in the form of a start up & coming app to accompany the customer on there travels,
of course this app is top of the line , with the up to date features, with a mini feature of an api in the form of an weather API, this is the give the user a qiuck view of the up and coming app , 
that is the scope of the marketing call for the app page 

With one more element which comes in the form of a restaurant API , powered GoogleGeoLoaction, this will request the user location , if the user chooses to agree to the browser then they will have the abilty to 
see & read the distance from there currrent location to the restaurant which is displyed on the front end, or the users viewport , while this feature does not have a database, it requires the data form a small json format in our js script, keepin this mind to be very slim with the data bacause of googles page speed , 

This Project also makes use of HTML form validation , aswell as numerous css & jquery liberares to add to the ux

Tested On  

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
- [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/)
    - The project uses **https://firebase.google.com/** to deploy the production project 

On deploying this project , I explored various options such as host providers & Linux Servers, but this approach would of been overkill as it would be hugly beinefcal to give myself the abilty to deploy with just one command line & a open secure connection by the way of Google.

 This led me to FireBase, FireBase is a service in which we can deploy static websites 
on a free tier with excellent documentation and configeration options, it a excellent choice & can also be upgraded with relevent ease,
 all of this operation is carried out in our google firebase console & Installed FireBaseCli, 

To Deploy this project you need to have the latest version of Node.js installed onlocal machine/pc
- After installing Node.js & Checking you have a version number, you will have to navigate to you your project folder
  & run firebase init , this will initilise your project directory with a Firebase.json file , this file holds the configeration for your deployment
- After initilisation you have to create can account with google, 
  once logged in to google you will have the abilty to access the firebaseCli & its commands
- Once you are satifactory with your project, you will have to create a project on G, google will give you a default folder of PUBLISH,
   then it is just a matter  
## HOW THE PROJECT WAS DEPLOYED


##### My project can be viewed fully deployed on Firebase [here](https://freestylerallrounder.firebaseapp.com/).

## THE FUTURE
##### I hope to develop on this project in the future to include Gaelic Football score statistics For this years Hurling and Football Championship. I intend to keep a database up to date on a weekly bases.

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
